For me, makeup does not necessarily mean it is clearly visible, but it means the effect it offers to the wearer without shouting \"look at my makeup.\" Instead, the effect I'm looking for is one you look so good, so confident in yourself that when you enter a room everyone who looks at you tries to figure out what's different about you. This is the result I want to achieve for my clients: by applying professional makeup, understanding different styles and long-lasting application technique.",
